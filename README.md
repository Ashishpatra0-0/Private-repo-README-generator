1.  **Clone the repository**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the project to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ashishpatra0-0/learn-git.git

## 🚀 Usage
Once the repository is cloned, you can start using it to practice various Git commands.

Here are some examples of what you can do:

*   **Check the status of your repository**:
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
*   **Create or modify a file**: Use your favorite text editor to make changes to `index.html` or create new files (e.g., `about.html`).
*   **Add changes to the staging area**:
    ```bash
    git add .
    # Or to add a specific file:
    # git add index.html
    ```
*   **Commit your changes**:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Your meaningful commit message describing the changes"
    ```
*   **View commit history**:
    ```bash
    git log
    ```
*   **Create a new branch**:
    ```bash
    git branch my-new-feature
    ```
*   **Switch to a new branch**:
    ```bash
    git checkout my-new-feature
    ```
*   **Merge branches**: (After making changes on `my-new-feature` and switching back to `main` or `master`)
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git merge my-new-feature
    ```
